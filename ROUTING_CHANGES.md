# Dashboard Routing Implementation

## Overview
Implemented proper Next.js routing for different dashboard views with URL-based navigation.

## Changes Made

### New Routes Created
- **`/`** - Overview dashboard (home page)
- **`/daily`** - Daily dashboard with hourly breakdown
- **`/weekly`** - Weekly dashboard with daily breakdown
- **`/monthly`** - Monthly dashboard with daily breakdown (route exists but not in navigation)

### New Components
1. **`DashboardLayout.tsx`** - Shared layout component containing:
   - Header with app title
   - Navigation bar
   - Footer with scan history link
   - Scan button (in development mode)

### Updated Components
1. **`DashboardNavigation.tsx`**
   - Removed props-based navigation (`currentView`, `onViewChange`)
   - Added Next.js `Link` components for proper routing
   - Added `usePathname()` hook to detect active route
   - Navigation now updates URL when clicked
   - Shows Overview, Daily, and Weekly tabs

2. **`page.tsx`** (Home/Overview)
   - Extracted overview logic from old Dashboard component
   - Now uses `DashboardLayout` wrapper
   - Maintains item fetching and auto-scan functionality
   - Shows table/card view toggle

3. **New Page Files**
   - `app/daily/page.tsx` - Renders DailyDashboard in layout
   - `app/weekly/page.tsx` - Renders WeeklyDashboard in layout
   - `app/monthly/page.tsx` - Renders MonthlyDashboard in layout

## Benefits
- ✅ URL updates when switching dashboards
- ✅ Direct access via URL (e.g., `/daily`, `/weekly`)
- ✅ Browser back/forward buttons work correctly
- ✅ Shareable URLs for specific dashboards
- ✅ Better SEO and navigation
- ✅ Follows Next.js App Router conventions
- ✅ Consistent caching behavior across all dashboards

## Removed Files
The old `Dashboard.tsx` component has been deleted as it's been completely replaced by the new routing structure.

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Navigate to `/` for Overview
2. Navigate to `/daily` for Daily analytics
3. Navigate to `/weekly` for Weekly analytics
4. Verify URL updates when clicking navigation tabs
5. Verify browser back/forward buttons work
6. Verify active tab is highlighted correctly
7. Verify cached data loads instantly on subsequent visits
